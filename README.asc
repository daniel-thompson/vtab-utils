vtab utilities
==============

The vtab utilities are a collection of programs to work with vertical tabs.
Vertical tabs are an ASCII based format but, inlike traditional monospaced
tabs, they are arranged vertically rather than horizontally. Arranging the
tab in this form makes it easy to edit using simple tools like text editors.

The vtab utilities are primarily used to convert vtab into other formats that
are easier to play along to. Supported output formats include lilypond and 
traditional (horizontal) asciitab
