vtab utilities
==============

The vtab utilities are a collection of programs to work with vertical tabs.
Vertical tabs are an ASCII based format but, inlike traditional monospaced
tabs, they are arranged vertically rather than horizontally. Arranging the
tab in this form makes it easy to edit using simple tools like text editors.

The vtab utilities are primarily used to convert vtab into other formats that
are easier to play along to. Supported output formats include lilypond and 
traditional (horizontal) asciitab.


Introducing vtab syntax
-----------------------

The following example, which shows how a single octave C major scale can be
expressed in vtab, shows the flavour of vtab.

Scale of C major
================

Key: C
Time: 4/4

  ===========
# The 8 causes each line to be treated as an eigth note (quaver)
  | 3 | | | |  8
  | | 0 | | |
  | | 2 | | |
  | | 3 | | |
  | | | 0 | |
  | | | 2 | |
  | | | | 0 |
  | | | | 1 |
  -----------
  | | | | 0 |
  | | | 2 | |
  | | | 0 | |
  | | 3 | | |
  | | 2 | | |
  | | 0 | | |
  | 3 | | | |  4

The ascii backend, great for sharing your riffs via e-mail or on forums,
converts this into traditional (horizontal) asciitab:

----
|-----------------|---------------|
|-------------0-1-|-0-------------|
|---------0-2-----|---2-0---------|
|---0-2-3---------|-------3-2-0---|
|-3---------------|-------------3-|
|-----------------|---------------|

vtab is richer than horizontal tab and included timing information,
allowing us to convert the above into printable output using the
lilypond backend:

//lilypond SVG tickles bugs in the firefox SVG renderer so for now
//we have to put up with png.
//image::doc/scale.svg[]
image::doc/scale.png[]


Quickstart
----------

vtab-utils uses distutils to automate installation and packaging.
That means the simplest possible way to get started is:

----
./setup.py install
----

If you want your package manager to help you keep track of vtab-utils
you can use one of the bdist_rpm or bdist_dpkg options. For example:

----
./setup bdist_rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh dist/vtab-utils-*.noarch.rpm
----

Finally vtab-utils comes with a built-in test suite containing a
mixture of unit tests and complete toolset tests. If you have made
any changes to the module you can test your changes with:

----
./setup.py test
----

See https://docs.python.org/3/install/index.html for more information
about distutils based installers.
